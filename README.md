## 🗃️ Dataset

All source data is stored in the [`dataset/`](./dataset/) folder. Three CSV files are used:

| File | Description | Columns |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `customers.csv` | Customer master data | `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `city`, `email`, `signup_date` |
| `orders.csv` | All order transactions | `order_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `payment_method`, `order_date` |
| `products.csv` | Product catalogue | `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `price` |

> These three tables are loaded into SQL (via Python) and joined together to perform all the analysis below.
